To use variants, you would need to use the command !variants. The usage of this command is:
!variants <CID> <variant_style> <integer>


So, for example; lets say we wanted the Purple Skull Trooper. The command we would type in would be:
!variants CID_030_Athena_Commando_M_Halloween clothing_color 1

CID_030_Athena_Commando_M_Halloween Is obviously the the CID, clothing_color is the variant_style & 1 is the integer.

Here is the full list of variant styles for you to play around with styles!

item (str) – The variant item type. This defaults to AthenaCharacter which is what you want to use if you are changing skin variants.

parts_config (str) – The type of parts you want to use. The available types are Emissive (default) and Mat.

pattern (Optional[int]) – The pattern number you want to use.

numeric (Optional[int]) – The numeric number you want to use.

clothing_color (Optional[int]) – The clothing color you want to use.

jersey_color (Optional[str]) – The jersey color you want to use. For soccer skins this is the country you want the jersey to represent.

parts (Optional[int]) – The parts number you want to use.

progressive (Optional[int]) – The progressing number you want to use.

particle (Optional[int]) – The particle number you want to use.

material (Optional[int]) – The material number you want to use.

emissive (Optional[int]) – The emissive number you want to use.
